## Contributing

[temper][] is developed using [Scott Chacon][]'s [GitHub Flow][]. To
contribute, fork [temper][], create a feature branch, and then
submit a [pull request][].  [GitHub Flow][] is summarized as:

- Anything in the `master` branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of
  `master` (e.g., `new-oauth2-scopes`)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same
  named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for
  merging, open a [pull request][].
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can
  merge it into master.
- Once it is merged and pushed to `master`, you can and *should* deploy
  immediately.


### Testing

Prior to submitting a [pull request][], please run:

```bash
$ make check
$ make lint
```

To update and view the test coverage report:
